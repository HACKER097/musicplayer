# musicplayer
This is a TUI music player, its pretty terrible but its mine, I am working to make it somewhat good, i hope you try it and tell me how i can improve, thanks!

SETUP:
`bash setup.sh`
USAGE:
K,M : UP,DOWN
N : PLAY
Q : QUIT

these are pretty bad controls you can change them if you some how manage to read my code
